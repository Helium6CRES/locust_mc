In CMakeLists.txt, commented out lines 234-240 to avoid a conflict with my installed boost libraries.
The universal RandomLib library did not match the x86_64 boost libraries.

 In cmake/randomlib-config.cmake.in, removed the inclusion of randomlib-depends.cmake on line 32.
 For the purpose of an included build, the library target defined in that file conflicted with the existing library target.
